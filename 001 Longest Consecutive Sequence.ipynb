    "**Difficulty:** Medium\n",

    "**Problem Statement:** \\\n",
    "Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example 1:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2] \\\n",
    "Output: 4 \\\n",
    "Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. \\\n",
    "Therefore its length is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example 2:*\n",

    "## Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation**: \\\n",
    "It's tempting to sort the array and find the longest unbroken sequence. However, sorting is ~O(n*log(n)) time complexity. So, it'snot acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plan**: \\\n",
    "Hash lookup costs constant time. So, we could create a HashSet `set_num` of the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for each number `num` in the list `nums`, we can keep building up a counter of `current_length` while the next adjacent number to current number `current_num` i.e. `current_num+1` is in `set_nums`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we can't find the next adjacent number in `set_nums`, the while loop would break and we can update a `max_length` holder variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we return the `max_length`.\n"
