    "Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.\n",

    "# Definition for a Node.\n",
    "class Node:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):\n",
    "        self.val = val\n",
    "        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Test case format:\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.\n",
    "\n",
    "An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.\n",

    "**Observation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have to clone the nodes and their relashionships, we need to traverse the entire original (old) graph. This would require a for loop: `for neighbor in node.neighbors`. While traversing, we create cloned (new) graph by cloning next nodes (IF not already cloned; for this we would need a HashMap {old_node : new_node}) and copying the relashionships in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plan**:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will define a function `clone` which shall have two jobs: clone the current node `nod` if not already cloned, and clone the relationship by appending `nod.neighbors` to the clone of `nod`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how will we know if a node is already cloned or not? Also, how would we locate this 'new' node which may have been created/cloned several iterations ago. We can achieve both of these tasks with a dictionary `old_new` which stores the map {old_node : new_node}. If `nod` is found among keys of the dictionary, we don't need to clone it. When cloning is needed, we would create a `copy`, make an entry to `old_new`, and clone the neighbors of `nod` into it.\n"
